content1: "Originally from India, I moved to Australia in 2019 for work, and that's when my love affair with travel began. From an early age, I have always been drawn to adventure and the thrill of exploring new places. As I journeyed to different places in Australia and immersed myself in different cultures, I found myself captivated by the beauty and diversity of the world around me."
content2: "I began to document my travels through photography, capturing the stunning landscapes and unique moments that I encountered along the way. But as I looked back on my photos, I realized that there was so much more to share with others. I wanted to share the stories and experiences of my travels in a way that would inspire and inform others, and so I turned to writing."

Writing travelogues has become a true passion of mine, and I love nothing more than sitting down at my laptop and bringing my adventures to life on the page. Whether I am exploring the bustling streets of a big city or the quiet beauty of a remote countryside, I am always looking for new stories and experiences to share with my readers.

Through my travels, photography, and writing, I hope to inspire others to pursue their own adventures and discover the beauty of the world around them. Thank you for joining me on this journey and I hope you enjoy reading my travelogues as much as I enjoy writing them. 

I started *CH810YA (pronounced "chai-ten-ya")* with a mission to give others a taste of what goes on in my mind, and I have been at it ever since.
