Planning your first backpacking trip can be a stressful experience, especially if you're doing it independently. As someone who has gone through the same experience, I understand the pressure you may be facing, and that's why I'm here to guide you through some steps that I've followed when planning trips around the world.

I have compiled a list of all the resources that I have used over the past 5 years to plan my backpacking trips. These platforms and websites have been incredibly reliable and have never failed me once. I hope that this list will be as helpful to you as it has been to me.

##### Start Planning Your Trip:

1. [Book your Flights](#book-your-flights)
2. [Book your Accomodation](#book-your-accomodation)
3. [Public Transportation](#public-transportation)
5. [Day Trips & Tours](#day-trips-&-tours)
6. [Travel Checklists by Chai](#travel-checklists-by-chai)

##### Book Your Flights


To plan a backpacking trip, the first step is to find the best deals on flights from your home country to your desired destination. My preferred platform for this is Skyscanner, where you can browse through available deals and sort them by price and flight duration to find the most affordable and practical route.

Skyscanner has a unique feature that allows you to select "Everywhere" as your destination, and the platform will list all the destinations you can fly to in order of cheapest to most expensive. This feature has helped me find countless affordable and practical routes, and I haven't found any other platform that does it better.

If Skyscanner doesn't list all the available flights, I also browse through Expedia to compare prices. And the final option is Google flights. You may not find any deals directly in the portal but at least you know if there's a flight and the price graphs. 

By using these two platforms together, you can compare prices and routes to find the best and cheapest deal possible. Keep in mind that this process can take several hours or days, depending on how complex your trip is. I usually spend at least a week browsing through Skyscanner and Expedia to find the most affordable and practical route for my trip.

##### Book Your Accomodation


With your flight booked, your plan is already halfway done. While the other parts of your trip can be improvised as you go, a little extra research can make your journey more enjoyable, such as finding great accommodation in advance.

For the first night in a new country, I usually look for hostels on Hostelworld. I try to find a place where many travelers pass through, so I can talk to them and get more information about the country I'm visiting. First-hand information is always the best, and there's no better place to find these travelers than a hostel. Trust me on this. I met my girlfriend in JJ's Backpackers when I was travelling Perth.

Hostelworld has an excellent selection of hostels, with many reviews to help you decide whether a particular hostel is right for you. On my first night, I usually choose a smaller, non-party hostel with a fun vibe to meet and talk to people. I've found that a full-blown party hostel can make it difficult to connect with others in meaningful ways.

If I'm looking for more privacy, which happens quite often when I've been on the road for a while, I book an AirBnB or hotel on Booking.com instead.

Booking.com also offers special discounts for returning users, giving you access to better deals that you wouldn't find on other platforms. Best of all, I've always been able to find accommodation on Booking.com, no matter which country I'm in. I can always count on them to find me a bed to sleep in every night.

##### Public Transportation


At times, it can be challenging to find information about navigating other countries. Therefore, my usual approach is to search for state transportation websites to learn about public transportation options such as intercity and metro services. This enables me to get an overview of the availability of buses or trains that I may need to take, and I can then proceed to make my bookings accordingly.

Greyhound is the best website for Travelling by Bus in Australia and I've done my East Coast and Outback trips on their services. They also offer "Whimmit Passes" where you get unlimited travel for certain period and it's the best bang for buck. 

Occasionally, the destinations I wish to visit are not accessible via public transportation, and I am left with no option but to book a tour and that brings us to our next topic.

For Travelling around Australia without a car, visit Greyhound Australia Website and explore their Whimmit Passes:

##### Day Trips & Tours


Upon arriving in a new city, I often seek out day trips or tours to join with other travelers. As a solo adventurer, this is the best way to explore places that may be too costly to visit alone.

My preferred sites to find activities and day trips to join are Trip Advisor, Viator and Get Your Guide. These platforms allow me to hit the ground running in a new destination while learning about the local culture from natives. Additionally, by joining shared tours available on these websites for longer trips, I can also save money.

For entrance tickets to expensive attractions, I use Backpacker Deals or Bookme.com.au to find great deals, along with flash deals on tours and activities in countries like Australia and New Zealand, where every penny saved counts.

###### Wise:
My recommendation would be Wise Card, an International Debit card that enables transactions in numerous currencies with minimal fees. What I find most useful is the unlimited Virtual Debit Cards feature, which lets you generate multiple cards to use in situations where you're hesitant to share your regular bank card information with a website or agency. You can explore other features and sign up for an account with {{< openurl " Wise here" "https://wise.com/invite/in/saiv147" >}}
