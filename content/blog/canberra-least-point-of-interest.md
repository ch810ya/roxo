Even though just a 3-hour drive away from Sydney, I was never interested in visiting Canberra. 

I looked up the web and when I searched for the places to visit in Canberra, there wasn’t even a single place that interested me to visit the city. 

When I was travelling to Snowy in October 2019, we had to visit Canberra for the Tesla charging station at the Canberra Airport and while returning, we drove through the city visiting the Parliament House and War Memorial. As it was evening, I found the lights on them interesting. But not interesting enough to take my phone to capture them. I have also seen the Captain Cook Memorial Jet from inside the car while driving through the Historic Waterloo Bridge Memorial and it was only a fountain. Who am I kidding? I travelled through Canberra again in January 2020 during my backpacking trip to Melbourne and never stepped outside the Canberra Central at Jolimont Centre. No regrets. 

Again in August 2020, I had to forcibly travel to Canberra because of my friends while returning from Snowy Mountains during my Camping Trip in Ben Boyd National Park. We went to the Parliament House to visit inside this time even though I was least bothered. But with no surprise or disappointment for me, the Parliament was closed to the public because of the whole COVID situation during the time. Again, No Regrets. I have never planned to visit the Canberra city nor will I ever plan to visit in the future. It has always been my least point of interest.
