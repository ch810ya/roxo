We reached the Saltwater Campground just before the sunset but by the time we set our camp, it’s already dark. 

I realised why camping is a bad idea in August but I don’t care. There’s nothing much to do in the dark so we made a campfire and cooked dinner.

I woke up around 4 AM and realised I underestimated the NSW weather. There’s no signal to check the temperatures but I’m pretty sure it’s below 0 C. I didn’t get enough blankets and even though my sleeping bag rating is 0 to 15 C, it’s no good for this weather. I’m freezing to death in these chilling temperatures, so I tried to sleep again.

I woke up around 5:30 AM again and I couldn’t take it anymore. Our tents are all wet with the fog and we cannot stay inside the tent anymore. Nor could we stay outside. I grabbed my Parka jacket and went to the beach by our campground.

My struggle during the entire night vanished once I looked at the most beautiful sunrise ever. The sun is slowly rising above the ocean while the mist is floating around. I could feel the cold breeze, but also, I cannot feel my hands anymore. So I put back my snow gloves and couldn’t take many pictures but I still remember the beautiful scene.

My goal of reaching the bottom-most part of NSW is now complete but at what cost. After assessing our current situation, we made a little change to our plans. We cannot go for another night with these wet tents and other camping gear, so we booked a hotel in Jindabyne for our stay tonight.
