This is the first time I’m going Kayaking. Although I did go river rafting back in India, Kayaking is a bit different. 

Our initial experience was not pleasant since the tides were high and the sea was rough. Our kayak capsized 2 times when we’re trying to get into the sea. But once we’re in the sea, it’s one of the best experiences I ever had.

Although I didn’t get to see any dolphins, the rest of the experience was so exciting and adventurous. We kayaked for more than an hour and I could feel the waves pushing the kayak. Being at the sea-level, so far from the shore, is definitely a thrilling experience. Although I snorkelled in the Great Barrier Reef at Cairns and Whitsunday Islands during my Backpacking Trip in December last year, this is a very different experience.
