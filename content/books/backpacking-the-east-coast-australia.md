description: "How I Travelled Australia Book One"
content_small: "Backpacking the East Coast of Australia was one of the most ambitious trips I have ever planned. As the holidays were approaching, I started to plan my trip to Cairns and Gold Coast but when I was discussing with my friend Mark who was a local, he suggested I visit the places along the way. That unfolded a lot of new destinations other than just the reefs and beaches."

Having travelled to a lot of places in India, I have finally got a chance to visit Australia for work. With my passion and enthusiasm in travel and photography, I started exploring Australia like the backpackers from other countries and with the backpackers from other countries. Over 2 years, I visited more than 200 places in QLD, NSW, ACT, VIC, TAS and SA states. I narrated my solo backpacking travel tales in this book so the world and I can relive the same moments years later and still feel the same experience.

> *This book is a part of my bigger project “How I Travelled Australia” and will be followed by “Road Trip Edition” and "my Spirit of Tasmania".*
