Backpacking the East Coast of Australia was one of the most ambitious trips I have ever planned. As the holidays were approaching, I started to plan my trip to Cairns and Gold Coast but when I was discussing with my friend Mark who was a local, he suggested I visit the places along the way. That unfolded a lot of new destinations other than just the reefs and beaches.
