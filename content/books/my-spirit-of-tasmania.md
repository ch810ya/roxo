content_small: "It's December and all the states have started opening the borders. Although my initial plan was to stay in the Blue Mountains for a week or two to learn abseiling or move to the coast to learn open water diving, I stumbled upon the idea that I can actually move out of state for a month. Since my roommate could not confirm the plans for our road trip to Adelaide, I have once again got the opportunity to go for a solo trip. Only this time, I skipped planning at all."

I know that I have to visit Adelaide but I also want to experience the outback in Northern Territory. I don’t exactly remember how my entire destinations are flipped but I ended up booking YHA in Hobart for 2 weeks. Tasmania was never on my top list but somehow I really wanted to go there. I don't know what I’m gonna do there for 2 weeks but I know I have to go. My initial plan was to go to Tasmania and then fly to Adelaide from there but I booked Spirit of Tasmania from Devonport to Melbourne. Good going there, Chai!

My first travelogue “Backpacking the East Coast of Australia” reached #1 in Amazon Best Sellers under Arts & Photography and Travel categories, and "my Spirit of Tasmania" reached #1 in Amazon Best Sellers under Photo Essays and Australia & South Pacific Travel categories.

The Series : How I Travelled Australia, is not in anyway a Travel guide or just a collection pictures taken randomly at every place. As the name suggests “How I Travelled Australia“, the series of books let the readers experience the Beauty of Travel and the Love of People along my journey of being a Digital Nomad. And my photos show the true beauty of nature and a different perspective to this world.

> *The Series is a Travelogue of my journey in Australia and is a truly personal experience.*
