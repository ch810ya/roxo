I just started unpacking my bag to get into something comfortable and then, a pretty Asian girl enters the room, rewriting my entire stay in Melbourne.

“You just in?”, she asked.

“Yeah, I’m coming from Tasmania. How about you?”

“I stay in Melbourne on weekends and Gisborne during the rest of the week.”

“That’s interesting. Where are you from?” “I’m from Japan.”

“こんにちは!”, I said bowing my head.

It has been 2 years since I moved to Australia and I have been travelling across the country all this time. After travelling from Devonport by the Spirit of Tasmania, I had to spend a day in Melbourne to get a bus to Adelaide. When I reached the hostel in Melbourne, I met a Japanese girl and we started spending all my time in Melbourne together and grew close to each other.

This tale tells about How a girl I met randomly has rewritten my entire stay in Melbourne and how it affected my life since.
