This tale tells about How a girl I met randomly has rewritten my entire stay in Melbourne and how it affected my life since.

My first travelogue “Backpacking the East Coast of Australia” reached #1 in Amazon Best Sellers under Arts & Photography and Travel categories, and "my Spirit of Tasmania" reached #1 in Amazon Best Sellers under Photo Essays and Australia & South Pacific Travel categories.

The Series : How I Travelled Australia, is not in anyway a Travel guide or just a collection pictures taken randomly at every place. As the name suggests “How I Travelled Australia“, the series of books let the readers experience the Beauty of Travel and the Love of People along my journey of being a Digital Nomad. And my photos show the true beauty of nature and a different perspective to this world.
