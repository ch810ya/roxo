I’m not the one with the attitude “If I get corona, I get corona. That’s not gonna stop me from travelling“ but travelling with all the regulations and safety measures in practice has definitely made my days refreshing and motivated during the tough days of the pandemic. 

As the days passed by, the interstate travel was open between NSW and Victoria which led us to make our way into Melbourne. After returning to Sydney, I had the idea of one-day road trips to nearby towns as the restriction started to ease. It unlocked so many different things and mania of Road Trips was started. As I was switching between projects frequently, I was able to make the trips on weekdays which gave us more chance of faster travel with the less traffic on road and fewer people at places we go.
