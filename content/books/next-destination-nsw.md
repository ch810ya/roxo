As the days passed by, the interstate travel was open between NSW and Victoria which led us to make our way into Melbourne. After returning to Sydney, I had the idea of one-day road trips to nearby towns as the restriction started to ease. It unlocked so many different things and mania of Road Trips was started. As I was switching between projects frequently, I was able to make the trips on weekdays which gave us more chance of faster travel with the less traffic on road and fewer people at places we go.

My first travelogue “Backpacking the East Coast of Australia” reached #1 in Amazon Best Sellers under Arts & Photography and Travel categories, and "my Spirit of Tasmania" reached #1 in Amazon Best Sellers under Photo Essays and Australia & South Pacific Travel categories.

The Series : How I Travelled Australia, is not in anyway a Travel guide or just a collection pictures taken randomly at every place. As the name suggests “How I Travelled Australia“, the series of books let the readers experience the Beauty of Travel and the Love of People along my journey of being a Digital Nomad. And my photos show the true beauty of nature and a different perspective to this world.
