After my journey to the Australian Outback, and the beautiful state of Western Australia, I travelled Indonesia with Wida, an Indonesian. I’ve travelled to Bali, Ubud, Nusa Penida, Gili Islands and then from Lombok to Labuan Bajo (Flores) via Komodo Island on a 4Days/3Nights Boat trip. I’ve documented my experiences in this Photography Travelogue as a token of my travel tales under the name "How I Travelled Indonesia".

This book is a continution of my series "How I Travelled Australia”.
