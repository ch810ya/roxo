Indonesia is located in Southeast Asia, between the Indian and Pacific oceans. This collection of more than 17,000 islands hides many natural wonders. In recent years it has become one of the most visited countries in Asia. And for Australians in Perth, Bali is a lot closer and cheaper than Sydney.

Bali is one of the most magical islands you will ever visit in the world. Its incredible nature, tranquility, culture and people.

People are drawn to the culture and religion in Bali and it has more than 20,000 temples. I try to fit in as a local, but turns out I look very different despite being a Hindu and brown. 

Where ever I go, I'd rather be a local so I never plan my trips with the default itineraries. Wida, being an Indonesian helped me travel the country as a local. I mean, I fit in perfect as Indonesia and India are quite similar.

###### Tegalalang Rice Terraces

These famous rice terraces in Tegalalang are an iconic part of the Balinese landscape. There are rice fields located all over
Bali Island, but Tegalalang is known for being one of the most beautiful.
The town of Tegalalang is super cute, with arts and craft market stalls lining the streets along with traditional foods and gifts. The rice cycle at the terraces is three months in Bali, so if you're visiting a few different rice fields you are more than likely to find one that is completely green and luscious while others might be at an earlier stage of their cycle.

Nusa Penida is one of the best island destinations of Asia. Overflowing with natural beauty, Nusa Penida is home to dramatic coastlines, with extremely tall limestone rocks looming over perfect lagoons filled with crystal clear water and crazy steep hikes down to some of the most beautiful beaches in Indonesia.

Due to the road conditions on the island, it would be extremely difficult to visit both the east and west sides of the island on the same day. But it's not impossible. And that's what we did. 

{{< figure src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ch810ya-v.appspot.com/o/roxo%2Fimages%2Fdestinations%2Fasia%2Findonesia%2Fdamn-i-love-indonesia%2Fnusa.jpeg?alt=media&token=b51bcca5-848a-4308-9997-c2c217d2e7b5"  >}}


###### Diamond Beach

Diamond Beach is an untouched, white-sand, and silky blue water bay on the eastern tip of Nusa Penida. A stunning white beach, silky blue water, limestones, and palm trees are creating a dream destination. 

{{< figure src="https://firebasestorage.googleapis.com/v0/b/ch810ya-v.appspot.com/o/roxo%2Fimages%2Fdestinations%2Fasia%2Findonesia%2Fdamn-i-love-indonesia%2Fdiamondbeach.jpeg?alt=media&token=6779be88-136d-447c-b452-157376f652ab" caption="Diamond Beach" >}}

###### Kelingking Beach

The most famous and popular place in Nusa Penida, you've definitely seen a photo of Kelingking Beach before.
If driving from East to the West side of the island is an adventure, count the climbing down and back up this super steep hill as the ultimate adventure. It took us about an hour to go down and you would think it should take about 2 hours to climb up. But surprisingly it was comparatively easy to climb up the hill. And, only took us about 30 minutes.

###### Broken Beach

Sitting right next to Angels Billabong, Broken Beach is just stunning. This little circular walk is known for its views of the arched tunnels in the cliffs and the beautiful little pool that sits in the middle.
The walk around the beach is relatively flat and easy and definitely worth it if you're visiting the area. There are lots of points along the way that offer stunning views of both the beach itself, as well as the rugged coastline of the island.

###### Angels Billabong

A beautiful natural rock pool that opens up straight into the ocean, Angels Billabong is stunning but quite dangerous.
This natural infinity pool offers some super clear and beautiful water, and you're able to swim throughout the lagoon if you would like.
If you're checking out the rock pool from the cliffs surrounding it, be very careful. The rocks are often slippery and waves can smash onto the rocks unexpectedly. Be aware of the people around you and listen to the advice of the guides in the area.

The Gili Islands are a small archipelago located off the northwest coast of Lombok, Indonesia. Comprised of three main islands – Gili Trawangan, Gili Meno, and Gili Air – these tropical paradise islets are a popular destination for tourists seeking sun, sand, and crystal-clear waters.

Gili Trawangan, also known as Gili T, is the largest and most developed of the three islands. It is known for its vibrant nightlife and is a popular spot for diving and snorkeling. Gili Meno, on the other hand, is the quietest and most serene of the islands, making it a perfect retreat for those seeking a more peaceful and laid-back vacation. Gili Air is a mix of the two, offering a bit of both worlds with a balance of lively and relaxing activities.

One of the main attractions of the Gili Islands is their stunning beaches, which are dotted with palm trees and offer crystal-clear waters and white sandy shores. The islands are also home to a variety of marine life, making them a popular spot for snorkeling and diving.

In addition to the natural beauty of the islands, the Gili Islands are also home to a diverse range of restaurants and cafes, offering a variety of local and international cuisines. The islands also offer a range of accommodation options, from luxury resorts to budget-friendly guesthouses, catering to travelers of all budgets and preferences.

Overall, the Gili Islands offer a perfect blend of relaxation and adventure, making them a must-visit destination for anyone seeking a tropical escape.

Labuan Bajo is a small fishing town located in the western part of the island
Flores in Indonesia. Although a part of Indonesia, it's quite different from all
the places that we've been to, for the past 2 weeks. We flew
back to Bali, the next day, to catch our flight to Sydney.
